# Notes
# roots are inside the unit circle then stable
# close to 1 marginally stable
# close to 9 stable
# cutoff, tailoff: decreasing to 0
# significant corr at lollipops in pacf
# cutoff in acf, tailoff in pacf: ar
# cutoff in pacf, tailoff in acf: ma

#
# # Strongly seasonal. Partially stationarity. looking at local peaks (~) and overall decreasing residuals in ACF, stationarity in ADF
# # and rolling mean being stable for raw data. Need to check order by looking at PACF plot.
# # Depending on that, decide whether to difference or not probably need to use SARIMA. Multiplicative model.
#
# # DASH app. Different Tabs. Enter order. display ACF/PACF, ADF., etc.

# SARIMA model with MA on the right tail ticks.
# Seasonal diff with season=24 (hrs) followed by first order non-seasonal differencing
